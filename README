#Python DigiTemp Metricfire connector

This program queries temperature sensors and upload the data to
[metricfire](http://metricfire.com) via its python API.  It will run until
terminated by ctrl-c. Alternatively have a look at the --once and --quiet
command line switches to run under cron.

## Building the sensors
TODO: Link to websites describing the process.

## Configuration
The various runtime parameters are set in config.py. The api-key can also be
specified in an own file. The various configuration parameters are documented
in config.py itself.

## Supported command line switches:
  --once      : Run only once and exit after uploading the data.
  --quiet     : Don't output anything below ERROR level.

## Running with cron

The following line can be entered into your crontab (hint: run `crontab -e`)
and will have cron call the script once per minute. Errors during execution
will show up in your syslog and will usually be sent to you via email.
